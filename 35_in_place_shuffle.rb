# Write a function for doing an in-place â†´ shuffle of an array.
# The shuffle must be "uniform," meaning each item in the original array must
# have the same probability of ending up in each spot in the final array.
#
# Assume that you have a function get_random(floor, ceiling) for getting a
# random integer that is >=floor and <=ceiling.
